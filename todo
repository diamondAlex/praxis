move back and forth in the move list
castling is wonky, at least when the engine makes it (it calls board.move() directly, which might be the problem)
make engine play opponent move
add a recommended engine move
add games
add a way for opposite side to play most played move from a db of games
no reason to be querying the pieces everytime
